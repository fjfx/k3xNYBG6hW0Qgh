# Cardano (ADA) Price: Bullish Momentum Builds After 9% Surge Despite SEC Setback  

## Market Overview: ADA's 9% Rally From Critical Support Zone  

Cardano's native token ADA surged 9% on July 2, 2025, reaching $0.5960 after testing the crucial $0.50 support level. This psychological barrier previously triggered market reversals in February and April 2025, establishing itself as a key demand zone. The recovery brings ADA back to the upper boundary of a six-week descending channel, signaling potential bullish intent from buyers defending historical support levels.  

While higher timeframe charts maintain a bearish bias, this localized bounce demonstrates renewed interest at critical price levels. Immediate resistance now forms between $0.60-$0.62 â€“ a breakout above this range could catalyze further gains toward $0.66 and $0.72.  

## Technical Indicators: RSI Recovery and Fibonacci Reclaim  

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) for ADA has climbed to 43.12, showing early recovery from oversold territory. This technical improvement aligns with price action reclaiming the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement level from the late-2024 low to the 2025 high. However, sustained bullish validation requires RSI to close above the neutral 50 threshold, a critical momentum checkpoint for traders monitoring ADA's technical health.  

Daily trading volume reached $1.52 billion on July 2 â€“ one of the highest figures in recent weeks â€“ though price failed to maintain momentum near $0.56. This discrepancy suggests market indecision or potential redistribution among institutional players.  

## On-Chain Analysis: Exchange Outflows Signal Accumulation  

ADA recorded $6.02 million in net spot outflows on July 1, according to blockchain analytics platforms. This significant movement of tokens from exchange wallets to long-term storage indicates accumulation behavior among major holders. Reduced exchange balances typically correlate with decreased short-term selling pressure, creating potential for price appreciation when demand increases.  

However, the muted price response around $0.56 reveals cautious market sentiment. This combination of on-chain strength and price stagnation suggests accumulation may be occurring at slower pace than previous cycles.

## Regulatory Landscape: SEC's Impact on Market Dynamics  

The US Securities and Exchange Commission's decision to halt approval of Grayscaleâ€™s Digital Large Cap fund introduces renewed regulatory uncertainty for crypto markets. While this development creates short-term headwinds, derivatives data shows trader optimism reaching 1-month highs, with bullish bets on ADA increasing despite the regulatory setback.

## Market Sentiment and Institutional Activity

The muted price reaction to increased volume highlights the market's cautious approach amid regulatory uncertainties. Professional traders remain focused on the $0.60 psychological level as the next major technical checkpoint.

## Strategic Outlook and Trading Considerations  

Traders should monitor the $0.60-$0.62 resistance band for potential breakout opportunities. A daily close above this zone could attract momentum buyers targeting $0.66 and $0.72. Conversely, failure to hold $0.52 may test deeper support levels at $0.48 and $0.42.
