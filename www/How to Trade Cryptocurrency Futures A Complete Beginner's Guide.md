## Understanding Cryptocurrency Futures Contracts

Futures contracts are standardized agreements to buy/sell assets at predetermined prices and dates. In crypto markets, these instruments enable traders to speculate on price movements without owning underlying assets. Key characteristics include:

- **Leverage**: Amplify positions with borrowed capital (typically 10x-100x)
- **Margin Requirements**: Minimum collateral to maintain open positions
- **Expiration Dates**: Contracts settle on specific dates (weekly, quarterly)
- **Settlement Types**: Cash-settled (USDT) or physically-delivered (crypto)
