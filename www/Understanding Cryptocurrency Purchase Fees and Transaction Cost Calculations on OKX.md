|--------------------|------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Fiat Transactions  | 0% (No Fee)      | Instant fiat-to-crypto conversion     |

**Pro Tip:** OKX offers fee discounts through its native token (OKT) and tiered trading volume programs, which can reduce costs by up to 40% for active traders.

## 2. Bitcoin Network Fee Mechanics

While OKX handles internal transaction costs, blockchain network fees require special consideration. Bitcoin's unique fee structure operates differently from exchange-based pricing models.

### 2.1 Bitcoin Transaction Fee Calculation

Bitcoin's fee architecture depends on:
- Transaction data size (measured in bytes)
- Current network congestion
- Transaction priority settings

**Example Calculation:**  
A standard 200-byte transaction at 20 satoshis/byte = 4,000 satoshis (~$0.02 at $30K BTC price)
