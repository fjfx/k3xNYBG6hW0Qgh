## Understanding Pre-Market Trading Mechanics

### How Bitget's Pre-Market Functions
Bitget's pre-market trading mechanism offers a flexible environment for buyers and sellers to negotiate prices before tokens enter mainstream markets. For SOON, two settlement options are available:
- **Coin Settlement**: Direct exchange of SOON tokens
- **USDT Settlement**: Trading against Tether's stablecoin

This dual-system approach ensures accessibility for both crypto-native traders and stablecoin users, fostering broader participation in early price formation.

### Key Features of SOON's Blockchain Infrastructure

SOON emerges as a groundbreaking Layer 2 scaling solution built on a custom **Solana Virtual Machine (SVM)** architecture. Its technical framework introduces several innovations:

| Feature                | Description                                                                 |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Modular Rollup**     | Streamlined blockchain interoperability through component-based architecture |
| **Decoupled SVM**      | Separated execution environment enhancing processing efficiency              |
| **Merklization**       | Advanced state validation mechanism for improved security                    |
| **Horizontal Scaling** | Parallel transaction processing across rollups for high throughput           |

These technical specifications position SOON within its "Super Adoption Stack," which comprises:
1. **SOON Mainnet**: Core blockchain network
2. **SOON Stack**: Development framework for dApps
3. **InterSOON**: Cross-chain interoperability protocol

## Strategic Implications for Blockchain Development

### Advancing Web3 Infrastructure
The SOON ecosystem addresses critical challenges in blockchain technology:
