## Preparatory Steps  

Before initiating any transfers, ensure you're using authentic software and understand the risks involved.  

1. **Download Official OneKey Application**  
   Visit the official OneKey website to download the wallet app for your device. iOS users require a non-China-based Apple ID for access. For security, always verify the domain name matches `onekey.so` to avoid phishing attempts.  

2. **Prepare Your Binance Account**  
   - Log into your [Binance account](https://bit.ly/okx-bonus)  
   - Ensure funds are in your Spot Wallet. If they're in Savings, Staking, or Futures accounts, transfer them to the Spot Wallet first.

| Ethereum (ETH) | Ethereum Mainnet    | Variable (gas-based) |
