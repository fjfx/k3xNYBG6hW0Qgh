# How to Stake ETH with Brick Towers Using Your Ledger Device  

Staking Ethereum (ETH) has become a cornerstone of blockchain participation, offering users the ability to earn rewards while securing the network. Using a **Ledger hardware wallet** with **Brick Towers** provides a secure, non-custodial solution for staking ETH. This guide walks you through the process step-by-step, ensuring you understand the requirements, technical details, and best practices for staking ETH with your Ledger device.

## Preparations and Key Considerations  

Before diving into the staking process, itâ€™s critical to understand the prerequisites and potential challenges.  

### Minimum Requirements  
To stake ETH natively with Brick Towers, you must have **at least 32 ETH** in your Ledger wallet. This threshold is set by the Ethereum protocol for validator participation. Additionally, youâ€™ll need a small amount of ETH (approximately **0.00075â€“0.00225 ETH**) to cover gas fees for the staking transaction. Gas fees fluctuate based on network congestion, so timing your transaction during off-peak hours can minimize costs.  

### Gas Fees and Timing  
Gas fees on the Ethereum network are influenced by demand. To reduce costs:  
- **Stake during off-peak hours**: The Ethereum network experiences lower congestion during Central European Time (CET) hours (e.g., 6â€“8 AM CET).  
- **Monitor gas prices**: Use tools like [Ethereum Gas Tracker](https://etherscan.io/gastracker) to gauge optimal transaction times.  

### Smaller ETH Holdings  
If you hold less than 32 ETH, consider **liquid staking** solutions like Stakewiseâ€™s Swiss Liquid Staking Vault. This allows you to stake smaller amounts, though fees may offset rewards for investments under $600.

## Step 3: Stake Your ETH  

With your wallet connected, youâ€™re ready to initiate the staking process.  

### Staking Workflow  
1. **Verify wallet address**: Ensure the address displayed in the dashboard matches your Ledgerâ€™s Ethereum account.

4. **Confirm transaction**:  
   - Ledger Live will prompt you to review the transaction details on your Ledger device.  
   - Accept the transaction on your Ledger, which generates a cryptographic signature and broadcasts it to the Ethereum network.  

### Post-Staking Activation  
After confirmation, your validator will enter the **activation queue**, which can take up to **9 days** depending on network load. Monitor progress via [beaconcha.in](https://mainnet.beaconcha.in/).

## Optimizing Gas Fees and Transaction Costs  

Gas fees can significantly impact staking profitability. Use these strategies to minimize costs:  
- **Time transactions**: Stake during off-peak hours (e.g., CET mornings).  
- **Batch validators**: Staking multiple validators in one transaction reduces per-validator gas fees.  

### Gas Cost Example Table  
| Validators | ETH Required | Gas Cost (ETH) | Gas Cost (%) |  
|------------|--------------|----------------|--------------|  
| 1          | 32.00        | 0.0015         | 0.0047%      |  
| 4          | 128.00       | 0.0030         | 0.0023%      |  
| 8          | 256.00       | 0.0045         | 0.0018%      |  

*Basis: ETH price = $3,000, gas price = 15 gwei*
